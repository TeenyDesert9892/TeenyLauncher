## FAQ

#### Why I made the launcher?

I decided to made the launcher because there is people like some of mi friends who doesn't have the oportunity of bying a minecraft copy and they don't want to install some unkown software in his computers so thats why I worked hard in building this and improving it with the time

#### Is it safe to use the launcher?

Actually it is and if you don't trust me check the code manually and test it by your own


## Installation
