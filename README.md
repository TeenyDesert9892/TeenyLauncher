## FAQ

### Why I made the launcher?

I decided to made the launcher because there is people like some of mi friends who doesn't have the oportunity of bying a minecraft copy and they don't want to install some unkown software in his computers so thats why I worked hard in building this and improving it with the time.

### Is it safe to use the launcher?

Actually it is and if you don't trust me check the code manually and read it by yourself.

## Installation

To install my launcher you will need to download one of the versions that is on the release/pre-release tags compatible with your system.

When you have downloaded succesfully you will need to uncompres the zip and place the content in a folder whorever you want and just with that you can execute it.

## How to run the source code

If you want to run the source code localy you can run it in a virtual enviroment of python with the next command in your terminal (remember to install the requeriments.txt):

``` shell
flet run
```
