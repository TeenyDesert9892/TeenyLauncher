# TeenyLauncher guide:

For using this launcher the only thing you need to do it is downloading the latest release, extract all the files in a folder and before that execute the file _TeenyLauncher.exe_ or _start.bat_ if you are in windows and if you are using Ubuntu _start.sh_ and wait a little to start the launcher.

And that is it, is easy to run.

But if you are using linux you may need to give permission to the file start.sh with _chmod 755 start.sh_.

WARNING: It is not a stable and definitive version at 100% of the launcher, if you have any issue try to contact with TeenyDesert9892.
